# Octoprint-Octohedron-ui
Octoprint ui concept

## Setup

Install the plugin like you would install any regular Python package from source:

    pip install https://github.com/schieska/Octoprint-Octohedron-ui/archive/master.zip
    
Make sure you use the same Python environment that you installed OctoPrint under, otherwise the plugin
won't be able to satisfy its dependencies.
